# BA820-Mall-Customer-Segmentation
Business Problem
Market segmentation refers to that the enterprise divides the customers in the market into several customer groups according to a certain standard, and each customer group constitutes a sub-market. There are obvious differences in demand between different sub-markets.
After market segmentation, the sub-market is more specific, so it is easier to understand the needs of consumers and determine the target market. Aiming at the smaller target market, it is easy to formulate special marketing strategies. Through market segmentation, enterprises can analyze and compare the purchasing potential, satisfaction degree and competition of each market segment, explore the market opportunities that are beneficial to the enterprise, and work out the new product development plan. By segmenting the market and choosing the suitable target market, the enterprise can concentrate people, money, materials, and resources to strive for the advantages in the local market, and then occupy its own target market.
Through market segmentation, enterprises can face their own target market and produce marketable products, which can not only meet the needs of the market, but also increase the income of enterprises. To accomplish this task, machine learning has been applied in many stores. Shopping center uses customer data to develop ML model to locate the right customers. This not only reduces the cost of production and sales of enterprises, but also improves the quality of products and comprehensively improves the economic benefits of enterprises.
